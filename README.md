Differences in Polygenic Associations with Educational Attainment in between West and East Germany around the time of Reunification

# Description
We explore geographical and historical differences in polygenic associations with educational attainment in East and West Germany around the time of reunification. Our study involves n = 1,930 individuals aged 25–85 years from the German SOEP-G cohort. We utilize a DNA-based measure of genetic influence – a polygenic index – derived from a prior genome-wide association study on educational attainment in democratic countries. Our results suggest that polygenic associations with educational attainment were significantly higher in East Germany postreunification, while remaining stable in West Germany. Negative control analyses using a polygenic index of height indicate that this genebyenvironment interaction is specific to the educational domain. These results provide initial evidence that the transition from an East German state-socialist to the ideologically diverse West German system amplified the genetic-education association. We emphasize the necessity for replication in larger German genetic datasets.
